		<br>That’s quite a challenge, isn’t it?  As far as education goes, we are utilizing STEAM as an approach to future-proof our learners for this day.
		<br>STEAM education, simply put, is the integration of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics.  We focus on STEAM subjects in schools so that our young adults are equipped with the necessary skills for the economy of the future.
		<br>Increasingly, employers are looking for workers who are creative problem solvers, innovative and critical thinkers, and able to use new technologies.
		<br>Such challenges mean STEAM is viewed as a way to provide an exciting opportunity for inquiry learning through the integration of curriculum and a design thinking approach that is engaging and relevant to students.
		<br>Himalaya International School Bangana, each one on campus will be trained to make safety not only a habit, but a culture.
